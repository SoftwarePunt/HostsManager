HostsManager
============
HostsManager is a user-friendly UI for managing entries in the HOSTS file written in C#. This may be a especially useful tool for (web) developers who often use temporary/fake hostnames for testing purposes.

**This is an old, incomplete project.**

I am releasing this in the hopes that it will be useful to others and to hopefully see it finished and improved further.
